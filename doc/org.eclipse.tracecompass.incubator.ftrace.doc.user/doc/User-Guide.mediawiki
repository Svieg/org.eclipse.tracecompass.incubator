= ftrace =

Support is currently limited to event tracing. The expected format is the human readable raw format.

== Generating a trace ==

There are two ways to generate the trace in the human readable raw format. Using ftrace via the debugfs filesystem or using the trace-cmd command-line tool.

=== Debugfs filesystem ===

Mount the debugfs filesystem using the following command:

  # mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug

The filesystem could be mounted elsewhere.

Before starting the tracer, traced events must be enabled by echoing ''1'' in the correct files.
For example, enabling ''sched_switch'' and ''sched_wakeup'' is done with the following commands:

  # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_wakeup/enable
  # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/enable

Recording of a trace is started by echoing ''1'' in ''tracing_on'':

  # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on

Recording is stopped by echoing ''0'' in the same file.
The trace can be obtained in raw format in the ''trace'' file:

  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

=== trace-cmd ===

Recording of a trace can be started by the following command:

  # trace-cmd record -e sched_switch -e sched_wakeup

The recorded trace would contain only ''sched_switch'' and ''sched_wakeup'' events. Outputting the recorded trace is done using the following command:

  # trace-cmd report -R

The ''-R'' argument is needed to get the raw format.
